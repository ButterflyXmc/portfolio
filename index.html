            <h3>Passionate Full-Stack Developer</h3>
            
            <p>Hi there! My name is Mahi and I'm a passionate full-stack developer who believes that software 
                developers are the architects of the digital world. With creativity and problem-solving skills, 
                we build innovative solutions that make everyone's lives easier, faster, and more efficient.
            </p>

            <p>My journey as a developer began in September of 2022. Since then, I've been on a mission to 
                continually improve my skills and knowledge. Through dedicated practice and exposure to a 
                variety of projects and programming languages, I've developed a strong foundation in 
                full-stack development.</p>

            <p>Outside of coding, I love to read, hike, and play badminton. These activities help me maintain 
                a sense of balance and energy, which I believe is important for success in any field. I'm
                always eager to learn and explore new technologies, and I'm excited about the future of web development.</p>

            <p>As a lifelong learner, I'm excited about the endless opportunities for growth and exploration 
                in the field of web development. I look forward to continuing to push myself and expand my 
                knowledge, and I'm always up for a new challenge.</p>

            <p>If you're interested in working together or just want to say hello, please don't hesitate
                to get in touch! I'm always excited to connect with other developers and learn from their 
                experiences.</p>

                        Some of the key features of the site include a fake contact us social 
                        media page, hours of operation, and a "Laugh with Us" page that includes

                        <p class="p-text">Using HTML and CSS, I was able to create a visually appealing

                            The project was a fun learning experience that helped me improve my HTML
